# cuneiform_network_analysis
This repository include: 
- The Perl script to generate network graphs (.gexf) out of encoded transliterations of cuneiform texts - examples in M. Maiocchi 2016, Exploratory Analysis of Cuneriform Archives: a Network Approach to Ebla Texts, SMEA NS 2 (http://smea.isma.cnr.it/?post_type=portfolio&p=1470).
- A sample input file, which is merely meant to provide a concrete example on how input data should be structured in order for the script to run properly.
- a Gephi file (https://gephi.org/) showing the final result after processing the .gefx file with a network graph software.
